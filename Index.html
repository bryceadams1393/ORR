      <h1>Welcome to Oaks Ridge Riders Snowmobile Club</h1>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p> Oaks Ridge Riders Snowmobile club is a family orientated club that believes in promoting the responsible enjoyment of the sport of snowmobiling. We are a nonprofit organization that was incorporated in 1974 with the goal of promoting safe and organized snowmobiling in our area. The club are members of The Illinois Association Of  Snowmobile Clubs, Wisconsin Association Of Snowmobile Clubs, Rock County Alliance, The Blue Ribbon Coalition, and The Tri County/ Winnebago County Alliance. Through these memberships we have access to a network of groomed trails throughout the Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin area. This is in addition to the 20 plus miles of trail we maintain.
		  We have beautiful trails around the Rockford area and connect to Wisconsin trails. Our members maintain the trails and they are open to the public. Please obey all trail signs so we don't loose our privilege to ride on them.
		  If you are looking to have some fun and want to help support the sport you love, come join our club
